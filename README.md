# Invento: a universal inventory system
A repository for final project in Object Oriented Programming (Java)

# What is Invento?
Invento is a application that aims to make a flexible inventory application that would cater any inventory-related needs. 

# How is it flexible?
The application will be built using NoSQL (MongoDb) to allow users to create their personal inventory schemas. This is advatageous to the fixed schema that SQL databases are resticted to. The nature of the database used in the application will allow users to features that are tailored for custom experiences.
